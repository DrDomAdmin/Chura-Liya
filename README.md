# Chura-Liya
Project "Chura Liya" is inspired from TrustWave SpiderLabs' project Smuggler (http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2014/11/smuggler-an-interactive-80211-wireless-shell-without-the-need-for-authentication-or-association.html).

It is a wireless interactive shell which utilizes 802.11 Management Frames to establish communication between two devices. It is different from usual wireless communication because it does not require any association or authentication to be performed before starting any communication.

Concept behind Smuggler tool was released by its author but the tool itself was not released. Project Chura-Liya comes out of this and shows the raw code and concept of the original project.
